# cmpt275-project iOS App "PPAL"

The objective of this project is to develop an iOS application that will help those with early stage
AD to not only rebuild existing neural connections, but to also create new, redundant neural
connections to slow down cognitive decline. The stakeholders will be those with Alzheimerâ€™s,
and their caregivers. The app would be centred around the person with AD, and their various
connections between people. The intended user of this app would be an early stage AD patient,
who is capable of using a mobile device, can communicate with others, and requires little help. The user interface would be kept simple and intuitive.
